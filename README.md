## Overview
[Configuration Read-only Filter](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_readonly_filter) allows to exclude certain configuration forms to be editable, when the site is on configuration read-only mode.
Filters can be created with set of form id or route name. Since filters are config entities, can be exported/imported like any other configuration.

## Features
1. Filter by Form ID
2. Filter by Route name - This is not supported yet.

## Dependencies
